<h2>Let the UI design "breathe"</h2>
To be able to let the design "breathe", I used whitespace. Each element or group of elements has their own space around them.


<h2>Create calmness and order with alignment</h2>
I used a grid system with 12 sections from left to right. With that the elements are aligned with each other right. It makes it easier to render through the website.


<h2>Use of contrast in design elements and color</h2>
The colours are contrasting - with the green that highlights important information. In addition to that, having the color of it fill gives it even more contrast. In the menu I made the headings black but the paragraphs dark grey to give the headings even more contrast and lighten up the page.

<h2>The 60-30-10 rule in use of color palettes</h2>
On the menu page I use
- ![#E5DDD5](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `#E5DDD5`
mostly (60) - #0000 or #666666 is the second mostly used (30) - and lastly #55BC44 is the least used but gives it some colour.

<h2>Use of scale in design elements and visual hierarchy</h2>
The headings 


<h2>Recognition of emotional cognition in the use of typography</h2>
I used Segoe UI as the typeface for this design. Its name basically says User Interface (UI). It is intended to improve the consistency in how users see all text across all languages, which would make it great because the website has different languages to choose from. The font has alot of variations to pick from f.x. semibold/semilight/black/light and more. It's a sans serif font which makes it open and friendly. 
It has been my favorite font for a while now because it's so easy on the eyes,looks good and it's not heavy.
