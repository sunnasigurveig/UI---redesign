<h2>Let the UI design "breathe"</h2>
To be able to let the design "breathe", I used whitespace. Each element or group of elements has their own space around them.


<h2>Create calmness and order with alignment</h2>
I used a grid system where I have 12 sections from left to right. Using that grid the elements are aligned with each other right and it makes it easier to render through the website.


<h2>Use of contrast in design elements and color</h2>
The colours are contrasting - with the green that highlights important information. In addition to that, having the color of it with fill gives it even more contrast. In the menu I made the headings black but the paragraphs dark grey to give the headings even more contrast and lighten up the page.

<h2>The 60-30-10 rule in use of color palettes</h2>
On the menu page I use #E5DDD5 (brown) around 60% - #0000 (black) or #666666 (grey) is around 30% - and #55BC44 (green) is around 10% (maybe even less)

<h2>Use of scale in design elements and visual hierarchy</h2>
The headings in the menu are bigger, darker colour and bolder than the paragraphs under them to make them stand out more.
The button is green and filled with colour so that it stands out and people will be more likely to take action.


<h2>Recognition of emotional cognition in the use of typography</h2>
I used Segoe UI as the typeface for this design. Its name basically says User Interface (UI). It is intended to improve the consistency in how users see all text across all languages, which would make it great because the website has different languages to choose from. The font has alot of variations to pick from f.x. semibold/semilight/black/light and more. It's a sans serif font which makes it open and friendly. 
It has been my favorite font for a while now because it's so easy on the eyes,looks good and it's not heavy.
